This repository contains the finished portion of the diffusion-based controller for muscle activations (unfinished code has not been included). The research was conducted under NAIR (Neuro AI and Robotics) group of the Spanish National Research Council. All programming for this project was done in the 'code' folder.

The model successfully generates muscle activations for the knee extension task with starting positions outside of training dataset and acheives **2.3% error** (Normalized RMSE) versus the expected trajectory. This is an improvement from prior work [Chavarrias et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11433)
